### Work done so far

1. Update the Periodic progress report w/:
  - A chapter describing partner by partner exactly which tools or portions
    thereof the partners are bringing to the project from other initiatives.
    The chapter should describe what improvements have been made to these,
    the relative resources required to do so and where they are used in the
    project using the high -level reference architecture described in D2.1
    as a common template.
  - A chapter describing the value proposition of the various components being
    worked on thanks to the European funding
  - Open call. Procedure for the selection of the evaluators. A minimum of 2
    external experts assigned to the evaluation of each proposal should be
    maintained.
  - Include a chapter containing the ethical and gender aspects.
2. Detailed explanation on how you are going to incorporate the needs and
   requirements of SMEs in the architecture.
3. Better explain open call impact on downstream activities
4. Establish a process to measure and assess each of the KPIs. These should
   be described and include:
  - Who is responsible for the measurement.
  - What is observed,
  - What is measured.
  - When measurement is done.
5. Deliverables should be submitted as version 1.0. Some WP1 submitted
   deliverables have a non traditional numbering scheme.


### Future work

It is unclear what use is expected to be made of the requirements.
Requirements need to be associated to development activities.

6. It is recommended to explain how security and privacy will be validated
   in the project, in particular end-to-end privacy and security (i.e. third
   party policies, multi-tenancy data privacy, etc.). A table of risks vs.
   measures addressed in the project would be useful
   TODO add issue to track this as part of D2.4
7. In order to ensure an objective and fair evaluation of the second open
   call, the procedure for the selection of the evaluators will be agreed
   with the EC and a report of the evaluation process and outcomes will also
   be shared with the EC.
8. Clarify which parts of the architecture will be open source in D9.4
   Mid-term communication and dissemination report. Make all open source
   software public as soon as possible.
   TODO add issue, clarify licensing scheme
9. It is recommended to focus on incorporating the needs and requirements
   of SMEs in the project architecture in order to strengthen the
   competitiveness and growth especially of SMEs in the manufacturing sector.
