Executive summary
-----------------
> The work done so far as seen from the moon.

This document describes the early design of a software platform to
enable the delivery of affordable artificial intelligence (AI) services
to the manufacturing industry as envisaged in the KITT4SME Description
of Action. A service mesh, multi-tenant, cloud architecture is proposed
that assembles AI components from a marketplace into a tailor-made
service offering for a factory, connects these components to the shop
floor, and enables them to store and exchange data in an interoperable,
secure, privacy-preserving and scalable way.

We have been following an iterative, experimentation-driven approach
to designing and documenting the platform architecture. Taking the
functional decomposition in the Description of Action as a starting
point, we have built a platform prototype by iteratively considering
requirements from the user journey, the security and AI analysis tasks
(from WP1) as well as the integration of partnersâ€™ software. In addition
to testing out our design ideas, this prototype has allowed us to
investigate some scenarios which we deem representative of real-world
use cases. Feedback from implementation tasks and regular reviews have
been instrumental in informing design decisions and refining the platform
design.

This work has resulted in the following contributions to the KITT4SME
project:

* A set of interlocked architectural viewpoints describing the
  technical aspects of the platform architecture and presented
  in this document.
* A companion living architecture document publicly available in
  the KITT4SME online repository. We will update the online version
  of the document as we refine the architecture in response to feedback
  from forthcoming implementation tasks.
* A fully functional platform prototype also publicly available in
  the KITT4SME repository with accompanying installation instructions
  and software documentation.

These contributions and the present document are intended for software
developers. In particular, the prototype and the architecture document
aim to offer sufficient guidance for an initial platform implementation.
Additionally these contributions should appeal to AI developers and
open call applicants alike in that they can learn about the platform
through direct experimentation with working software.
