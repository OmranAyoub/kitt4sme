> That's all folks!

**WIP!!**

### Addressing the requirements

TODO Rehash how the architecture tackles requirements & meets challenges

* sharing, open source ⟶ affordable
* NGSI ⟶ interop
* RAMP ⟶ marketplace
* Istio/OPA/.. ⟶ security
* K8s/Istio/.. ⟶ scalability
* ...and so on

TODO mention major design decisions, rationale & trade-offs

### Validation

TODO mention again validation through POC gave us some hope we've
put together an infra that can support the KITT4SME workflow (compose,
sense, intervene in particular) and integration w/ RAMP—see bullet
points in Intro/Scope.

### Next steps

TODO
* refine architecture as we go along
* mention this is gonna be a living doc kept in a repo alongside
platform code and will get updated as we refine the architecture and
get feedback from the various implementation tasks.
