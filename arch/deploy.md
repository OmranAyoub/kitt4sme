Deployment and operation
------------------------
> Rock & roll!


This part of the document is devoted to the deployment and operation
of the KITT4SME platform. First, we provide an overview of the placement
of the software and its execution on a cluster, including the instantiation
of platform services within the computing infrastructure. Then, we explain
how to connect the shop floor IoT environment to the running platform
instance. Finally, we discuss the continuous delivery of platform
functionality through an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) approach.
