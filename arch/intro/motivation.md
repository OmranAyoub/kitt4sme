Motivation and value proposition
--------------------------------
> Or why we're doing this.

We begin with reviewing the motivation behind the KITT4SME project
and its value proposition. While there is obviously so much more to
the KITT4SME project than it can possibly be summarised in a few paragraphs,
we will try to briefly outline the key aspects which should be kept
in mind in designing and evaluating the platform architecture.

Perhaps it is fair to say that KITT4SME starts from the basic observation
that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionise
the shop floor by considerably increasing product quality, for example
by detecting and correcting any anomalies. AI can optimise the reconfiguration
of a production line, potentially paving the way to lot size one production.
Furthermore, AI can even improve staff productivity by suggesting fatigue
and stress relief measures as well as personalised training.

The better the factory does in these areas the more profitable the company
can potentially be. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) constitute
the backbone of the European economy, thus the more profitable SMEs become,
the stronger the European economy becomes too. Nevertheless, despite
the potential benefits, very few SMEs have implemented AI solutions
in their factories. What is preventing them from jumping on the AI
bandwagon? As it turns out, mostly low budgets and lack of expertise.
The basic idea behind the KITT4SME project is to smash down these adoption
barriers by offering SMEs affordable, tailor-made AI for quality,
reconfiguration and human-robot interaction (HRI) through a marketplace
and an adoption support network.

The figure below shows an (informal) causal loop diagram to visualise
the relation among the ideas and concepts discussed thus far. An arrow
with a `+` sign indicates that as the quantities in the tail node grow
so do the quantities in the head node—e.g., more profitable SMEs yield
better economy. On the other hand, a `-` sign indicates that an increase
of the quantities in the tail node leads to a decrease of the quantities
in the head node—e.g., the lower the budget the less effective the
implementation of an AI project.
