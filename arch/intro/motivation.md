Motivation and value proposition
--------------------------------
> Or why we're doing this.

Let's quickly remind ourselves why we're doing this and what's the
project's value proposition. There's obviously so much more to Kitt4Sme
than I can possibly say in a few paragraphs but I'll try summing up
the key aspects we should keep in mind as we design the architecture.

Perhaps it's fair to say that Kitt4Sme starts from the basic observation
that AI has the potential to revolutionise the shop floor by upping
product quality considerably, for example by sniffing out and fixing
up any anomalies. AI can optimise the reconfiguration of a production
line, potentially paving the way to lot size one production. And AI
can even improve staff productivity by suggesting fatigue and stress
relief measures as well as personalised training. (But can AI make
coffee? Only time will tell :-)

The better the factory does in these areas the more profitable the
company can potentially be. SMEs make up the backbone of the EU economy
so the more profitable SMEs get, the stronger the EU economy gets too.
But despite the potential benefits, very few SMEs have implemented AI
solutions in their factories. What's stopping them from jumping on the
AI bandwagon? As it turns out, mostly low budgets and lack of expertise.
So the basic idea is to smash down these adoption barriers by offering
SMEs affordable, tailor-made AI for quality, reconfiguration and HRI
through a marketplace and an adoption support network.

Here's a causal loop diagram of sorts to show the lie of the land. An
arrow with a `+` sign means that if you get more of the stuff in the
tail node, you'll also get more of the stuff in the head node—e.g. more
profitable SMEs ⟶ better economy. On the other hand, a `-` sign means
more tail stuff leads to less head stuff—e.g. the lower the budget the
less effective the implementation of an AI project.
