The Kitt4Sme workflow
---------------------
> Delivering AI to the manufacturing industry.

We now turn our attention to how KITT4SME intends to deliver AI to
the manufacturing industry through its purposely designed workflow.
The KITT4SME workflow comprises five high-level activities: Diagnose,
Compose, Sense, Intervene and Evolve. The figure below shows a simplified
version of this workflow which is adequate for our purpose of introducing
the subject. However, the reader is encouraged to examine the details
of the workflow in the original proposal.

The first step in the workflow is the Diagnose step where given the
current state of the shop floor, the system determines, through a smart
questionnaire, how AI can help to transition the shop floor to a more
desirable state. Following that, in the Compose step, out of a graph
of software components, their wiring and configuration, that is the
marketplace catalogue, a minimal sub-graph is selected which is suitable
to achieve the desired transition to a better state. Then this tailor-made
software kit is deployed to the cloud as a set of services.

As soon as the shop floor is connected to those services, data start
flowing from the factory to the cloud where the tailor-made kit detects
and explains anomalies and visualises key performance indicators (KPIs).
These activities comprise the Sensing step. Perhaps, it might help to
think of the shop floor as a large dynamical system where one would
like to measure its current state with some degree of accuracy in order
to use the dynamics function (think AI model) to predict if the shop
floor is en route for a desirable or undesirable outcome, as shown in
the picture above with a sad emoticon face.

In the Intervene step, the system suggests and negotiates corrective
actions to steer the shop floor towards the desired production and
staff well-being goals. Finally, in the Evolve step, the system analyses
the outcome to improve the Diagnose and Compose steps, and to propose
personalised staff training.
