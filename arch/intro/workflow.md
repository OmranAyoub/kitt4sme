The Kitt4Sme workflow
---------------------
> Delivering AI to the manufacturing industry.

How does Kitt4Sme want to deliver AI to manufacturing SMEs? Through
its famed 5-step workflow of course! And here's a simplified version
of it, but I encourage you to actually have a look at the real
thing in the proposal.

The first step in the workflow is the diagnose step where given the
current state of the shop floor, the system figures out, through a
smart questionnaire, how AI can help transition it to a more desirable
state. Following that, in the compose step, out of a graph of software
components, their wiring and configuration, that is the marketplace
catalogue, we select a minimal sub-graph that's suitable to achieve
that transition to a better place. Then this tailor-made software kit
gets deployed to the cloud as a set of services.

As soon as the shop floor gets connected to those services, data starts
flowing from the factory to the cloud where the tailor-made kit detects
and explains anomalies and visualises KPIs. And that's the sensing step.
Perhaps it helps to think of the shop floor as a ginormous dynamical
system where we try to measure its current state with some degree of
accuracy so we can use the dynamics function (think AI model) to tell
if the shop floor is en route for a good or bad outcome, as shown in
the picture above.

In the intervene step, the system suggests and negotiates corrective
actions to steer the shop floor towards the desired production and
staff well-being goals. Finally, in the evolve step the system analyses
the outcome to improve the diagnose and compose steps, and to propose
personalised staff training.
