Scenarios

> Is our design just pie in the sky?

Surely not! (And pigs might fly.) No seriously, we've got to sketch
out the scenarios we think are representative of how the platform will
be used and then test them with the prototype.

So here's some ideas. First off, I'd be nice to have something for each
of the KITT4SME AI "pillars", e.g.

* **Product Quality**. Ginkgo's anomaly detection?
* **Reconfiguration**. Take inspiration from WP9's paper: "A decision-making
  framework for dynamic scheduling of Cyber-Physical Production Systems
  based on digital twins"?
* **Staff productivity**. Technimetro?

Also we should make sure we can accommodate more hairy scenarios like

* Video/Image processing: Rovimatica, R2M
* ROS---get some ideas from FIWARE webinars?

Thoughts?
