High-level project plan
-----------------------
> Timeline, deliverables, involvement.


Here's a little info-graphic to sum up who's responsible to deliver
which artefact and a delivery timeline for WP2.
Also in the Gantt chart below, I've used shadows of grey to give you
an idea of the amount of work each partner should put in.

There's a couple of things about this timeline that worry me. First
off, we should deliver a working platform by Mar 2022 which is in my
opinion quite tight, considering the number of people who can actually
work on the code. Second, supposedly an early stable version should
be available by the end of the year to be able to support open calls
in Jan 2022. This too is a very challenging deadline in my opinion.
I guess we'll have be proactive in managing scope and anticipating
issues if we want to make it.
