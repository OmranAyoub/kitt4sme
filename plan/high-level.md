High-level project plan
-----------------------
> Timeline, deliverables, involvement.


Here's a little info-graphic to sum up who's responsible to deliver
which artefact and a delivery timeline for WP2. The Gantt chart below
the timeline shows there's a task to deliver each major functionality
area detailed in the architecture, like persistence, security, FIWARE
middleware, and so on. Also, the name of the partners involved in each
task sit next to the task timeline and I used shadows of grey to give
an idea of the amount of work each partner should put in for that task.

Above the delivery timeline are all the artefacts we have to produce
with an indication of who's the designated victim responsible for
delivery. There are five reports to write: the architecture by the
end of June 2021, the data models by the end of 2021, then the security
design and the deployment manual in 2022, and finally the platform
report at the end of the project in 2024.

But surely we'll have plenty of fun writing code too. In fact, we have
a whole platform to deliver! We should try building stuff incrementally
so to have working software each step of the way which is going to reduce
integration risks and give us confidence we're on the right track to the
podium. Also, supposedly by January 2022 we should have built enough of
the core functionality to be able to support open calls. Then come March
2022, we'll have to release a fully tested, working platform which we'll
have to deploy for the various pilots starting in August 2022.

Given the resources we have I believe time's really tight. The obvious
consideration here is that we can't deliver production grade software,
but still we should be able to put together something good enough to get
a pass from the EU reviewers. So it's still going to be tough. Also,
there's a real risk of missing deadlines. In fact, we should deliver
a working platform by Mar 2022 which is in my opinion quite tight,
considering the number of people who can actually work on the code.
Also, supposedly an early stable version should be available by the
end of 2021 to be able to support open calls in Jan 2022. This too
is a very challenging deadline in my opinion. Then past the March 2022
release, we only have 4 months to stabilise the platform and deploy
it for the pilots. Again tight tight. Did I mention tight? I guess
we'll have be proactive in managing scope and anticipating issues if
we want to make it.
